`map()` is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to apply a function to each element of an array and return a new array with the results. The `map()` function takes a callback function as its first argument, which is applied to each element of the array, and an optional second argument, which is the this value for the callback function.

Here's an example of how to use `map()` to square the elements of an array:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let squares = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, the `map()` function applies the callback function 
```js
function(number) { return number * number; }
```
 to each element of the numbers array, and returns a new array squares with the squared values.

You can also use arrow function as callback function:

```js
let squares = numbers.map(number => number * number);
```

You can also use map() to transform an array of objects:

```js
let people = [{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }, { name: "Bob", age: 40 }];

let names = people.map(function(person) {
  return person.name;
});

console.log(names); // ["Alice", "Bob"]
```
The map() function creates a new array with the results and does not modify the original array. The original array is left unchanged.

It's important to keep in mind that the callback function passed to map() is invoked with three arguments:

- the current element being processed
- the index of the current element
- the array that map was called upon

You can use `map()` in a variety of ways, depending on your needs. It is a powerful tool for transforming arrays, and it can greatly simplify your code.
